# Wellness Journal

## Project Description
Wellness Journal is an Android app that promotes emotional wellness and daily self-reflection.  
It allows users to journal daily experiences, track mood, and note moments of gratitude.  
Users may optionally share anonymized data to provide organizations with morale insights while keeping privacy first.
